{"name":"Gumshoe","tagline":"A Chromium extension for discreet password logging.","body":"Gumshoe\r\n=======\r\n\r\nGumshoe is a Chrome extension for discreet password logging. It monitors\r\nthe submission of all forms with a password field and stores any unique\r\nlogin details in a local database.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThis thing's actually on the [Chrome Web Store](http://goo.gl/z8SIH).\r\nCan you believe it?\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nOnce installed, typing `gselog` anywhere should reveal the log management\r\npage. From here, you can search for records, delete those records, and\r\nchange `gselog` to something more creative.\r\n\r\nProvided that the extension is enabled and the user/password pair has not\r\npreviously been recorded, login attempts to most (semantically correct)\r\nwebsites should be available for review through the log management page\r\n(see above).\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshot\r\n----------\r\n\r\n![Gumshoe for Chrome (Windows 7)](http://i.imgur.com/1xyDl.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Aren't keyloggers scary and malicious?**\r\n\r\nYou could call it a keylogger, but 3 out of 4 pedants agree that it logs\r\nform submissions, not keystrokes. (It monitors strokes as it listens for\r\nthe passcode, but they aren't recorded.)\r\n\r\n**Right, but couldn't _you_ steal _my_ passwords?**\r\n\r\nNo. All data is stored locally using Web SQL; Gumshoe never communicates\r\nwith another machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\n\r\nGumshoe doesn't hurt users; users hurt users.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
